# Week 8 Response 

In looking at the methods discussed by both O'Neil and Chalabi, I believe I am most likely subjected to targeted ads when I consume media on internet. I heavily relate to the whole college predatory advertising when I was applying for colleges during my senior year of highschool. Even before then I would receive multiple college advertisements through mail or emails telling me to apply to their schools. Additionally, I was surprised to learn that the College Board mainly benefitted the for-profit colleges as oppose to helping students find their best college based on their interests. In high school, I was told to utilize the website in order to find my best fit college/university. Aside from colleges, I think targeted ads are a part of my everyday life. After searching for a particularly product or asking a simple question, I would receive multiple targeted ads related to searches by various search engines and websites. 

Although the internet may be better off without utilizing these methods, I believe they could be useful in quickly finding answers and having the availability for more possible options. When I was trying to decide on which college to attend, the college advertisements allowed me to have more options choose from since it is usually a difficult decision to make for a student. Additionally, having targeted ads sometimes provided me with products that I actually need or interested me. As Chalabi mentioned in her TedTalk, I think it's crucial how they frame the question or advertisements they show as there are many different interpretations that can be given among the lack of information provided. In certain cases such as using political polls for statistics, I think the internet would be much more egalitarian if they did not utilize them since they could be biased based and lack information.
