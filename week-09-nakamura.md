# Week 9 Response 

From my understanding of Lev Manovich's quote, he is describing how interactive media wants the participant/user to navigate and look at the perspective from the creator's mind, rather than their own. In a way, the user is being guided and taught how to perceive and feel things rather than operating freely. Just as the example he gives about hyperlinking, Nakamura explains how the users are ideologically trained into the "new media designer's mental trajectory," (Nakamura 16). It is a form of identification, in which the viewer goes through a process of taking on the role of that character in the film and posessing power through that new identity. This relates back to the issue of racialization and gendering in the media as discussed by Nakamura due to how characters of color and different genders are portrayed in that media. 

Although I don't use Twitter on the daily basis anymore, I believe the actions that they took definitely reflects the designer's or developer's 'mental structure' and their own identity by looking at their political beliefs. Twitter takes spreading misinformation very serious, which can be seen when they deactivated Trump's Twitter account during several incidents of misinformation throughout his time in office. By doing so, I'm operating in a media that allows me to not view the information that Trump is putting out to his millions of followers. Since he uses hashtags which are in a way like hyperlinks, users can click on that hastag to be taken to that topic where other users can discuss and comment their thoughts. Also notable is the character limit for each tweet as well as a limit to how much you can tweet in a day. I believe this reflects the designer's or developer's 'mental structure' of being straight to the point because users will have to decide how or what to word their tweets in order to stay under the charcter limit.
