# Week 12 Response 

Anna Anthropy starts off with discussing the problems of videogames. She lists the groups of people who often condemn videogames such as newscasters, religious leaders, and psychologists. The reasons they share are often that they have negative effect on children since they promote dangerous and unmoral lifestyles in addition to creating an antisocial atmosphere. On the other hand, the Anthropy has a different problem regarding videogames. As a queer transgendered woman, she identifies a lack of inclusion for people like her in such videogames which follow the same heteronomative roles. 

Additionally, she talks about videogames and other digital outlets are artistic forms that "transmit ideas and culture." The idea is that many forms of art share the same purpose which is to convey an experience for the viewer/participant. She futhers argues that since videogames have offered a limited perspective if they were to be compared with other art forms. These limitations are a result of small group of people creating these games that follow previous successful models in order to target to the same audience over and over again. This creates a continuous cycle that strains away from present day culture and inclusion to other people. 

In order to imrpove videogames, Anthropy voices that she wants a "plurality of voices" that will present a "wider range of perspectives" from a "wider set of experiences." Futhermore, these games should not be limited to the manufacturing of publishers whose goals are only to target the same small audience everytime. Games that are created by people that have different perspectives and experiences in order to provide an inclusive enviornment for the future of digital gaming. To summarize everything, she wants gaming creation to be "decentralized" and easily accessible for everyone to create. 

With more improvements to the accessibility in gaming and coding, we can gain an inclusive and welcoming environment that is not centered to one group or audience. Expanding access to gaming and coding can lead to more creative outputs and ideas. This also applies to all other forms of media.
