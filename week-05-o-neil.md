# Week 5 Response
Weapons of Math Destruction, or WMD as Cathy O'Neil describes are mathematical models that do more harm than good in society. These models tend to disproportionately target groups that are most vulnerable such as the poor, while benefitting the rich. O'Neil describes a model as a type of abstract representation of some process that will eventually guide ones' decisions. Models are created by including the most important details and simplifying that information to make it understandable to complete its task. However, they can overlook blindspots that can be problematic since they reflect ones' goals and ideologies.

In looking at how models work, O'Neil utilizes an informal internal model to create a meal plan for her family. She goes through many thought processes such as considering what their food preferences, assessing the success of the meal with what's given, and then adding any updates and adjustments to her model which creates a "dynamic model." She also mentions harmless models which provides transparency and is regularly updated. This could be seen in the baseball model provided as it utilizes statistics from identifying regular pitching or batting patterns in order to position their players. All of their assumptions and conclusions are visbible for everyone to see.

Additionally, these WMDs may reinforce inequalities. The recidivism model and predicitive model both enforce racist tatics on handling crime sentences. In the recidivism model, race is used as a determinant for future reoffendments. Both of these models are based off of generalized data and bias to predict a race's behavior. As a result, future cases will disproportionately affect black people by staying in a lengthier sentence and death penalty than their white counterparts for the same crime.
