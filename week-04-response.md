# Week 4 Response
An image that would be read differently if it was in a different medium could be commercialized photography specifically for a perfume or cologne. For example, a more recent advertisement campaign in 2019 for Ralph Lauren's "Romance" perfume features a model named Taylor Hill and her boyfriend. In one of the photos, the couple was shot hugging with Taylor Hill making direct eye contact with the camera and her boyfriend not making eye contact while resting his head on her shoulder. The top of the image consists of bold, black text in all caps stating "RALPH LAUREN" with the second line being "ROMANCE". In this photo, the linguistic message of "ROMANCE" would suggest some type of love or Valentine's Day if the person analyzing this was aware that the campaign was promoting near this time. The other message would be the bolded "RALPH LAUREN" at the top which is a very famous American fashion company, suggesting some sort of advertisement taking place. In the connoted image, the black and white may signify the dark sides of love or it could mean that love doesn't age. The way the couple is shot may show that the model is more important since she is seen as the one making direct eye contact as opposed to her boyfriend. The denoted image would just be a literal message of a couple in love, cuddling to show intimacy on a photoshoot.
