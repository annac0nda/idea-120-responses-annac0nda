# Week 7 Response 

In reading James Bridle's *Something is Wrong On the Internet*, I definitely agree with most of the arguments and solutions he made about the internet and its effects on the younger audience. He begins by mentioning how weird the YouTube algorithm is marketed towards kids where YouTube channels such as *Blu Toys* received million of views just from unboxing Kinder eggs. In my experience, I also enjoy watching unboxing videos from fashion and beauty YouTubers but I notice that those videos don't usually receive as much attention as their other videos. Although the videos are harmless, I agree with the author that there is something off about how these videos manages to get so much attention from the younger audience. Additionally, I also find that these current nursery rhyme videos are very creepy due to the excessive amount of trolls that have darkened them. I believe it's important to mention how older sibliings may play a role in directing the suggested videos towards their younger siblings. As Bridle has has discussed in the article, many of these trolls and YouTubers don't realize the amount of harm and trauma they may be causing to children viewing them. With the growing number of new social apps such as *TikTok*, older generations may not understand that both Gen-Z and millenials enjoy watching and creating videos with dark humor and memes. These videos are usually seen as harmless and a joke in my generation but the issue stemming from this is how readily available it is for younger audiences to view these disturbing content.  

Bridle's vision for how the internet 'should be' is a place where his children are able to safely go online without being exposed to the infrastructural violence coming from the integration of digital systems and capitalist incentives. After reading the article, I agree with his vision because I did not realize how alarming and disturbing some of the content really is. Bridle explained how these videos are usually created with less time, quality, and cost which makes it easier for anyone to butcher these videos and advertise them to the younger audience. As I scrolled through the article, the thumbnail photo of Peppa the Pig seemed like it was meme in my eyes. Upon actually reading what the video was really about, I couldn't imagine how disturbing the content would be for me let alone a child watching it. I also agree with Bridle's argument about how YouTube doesn't take the necessary steps to remove these videos or ensure further safety for their younger audience.
