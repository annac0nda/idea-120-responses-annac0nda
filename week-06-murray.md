# Week 6 Response

Murray's predictions about internet television and inhabiting virtual environments were successful as demonstrated in the movie, *The Mandalorian* with the usage of virtual sets instead of green screens. By using the LED screens, the directors were able to manipulate the background and control the lighting. This created the illusion of having the movie seem like it was being filmed at an actual set. Actors would be able to better envision the scene while viewers are able to look at the different points of views in the environment. In looking at several suggestions to incorporate expressive storytelling, the "simultaneous second screen engagement" reminds me of the **Netflix Party** option where you can invite friends and synchronously watch the TV shows and movies together while discussing about it in the group chat. This type of engagement could also be seen in premier videos on YouTube once a video is set to go live. Users could be seen chatting in the "live chat" box while watching the video at the same time.
