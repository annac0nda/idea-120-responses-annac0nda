# Project 4 Proposal 

I intend to keep my portfolio fairly simple and clean. I want a white center background so that it does not distract from the photos of gifs I use in my portfolio. Additionally, I want to have a centered title with my name on it, and a links to my projects below it. I will most likely use 2 photos and 1 gif to show a preview of my projects. They will folow a left to right format.
