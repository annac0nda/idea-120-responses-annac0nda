# Project 3 Proposal 

For my concept, I want to create a narrative based on a poem I wrote around 6th-7th grade. It will be written in the first person perspective, being the reader/participant playing the game. The main character in my narrative besides the participant is Donkey Dan, which the participant will soon find out as being the responsibile culprit in the story. It will mainly revolve around simple actions that are mostly "yes or no" based. The goal for my narartive is to get the reader to realize the hidden poem I wrote within the story.
