# Week 3 Response 

A physical and digital contemporary tool that could be utilized to create art that is considered *Gesamtkunstwerk* worthy is the 3D printer. According to *3D Printing.com*, 3D printing is defined as "a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file." Through additive processes, objects are created through the succession of laying down thin layers until the desired object is created. Before that, a printable file from the 3D software is sent to a slicing software where the 3D model is sliced down to be ready for 3D printing. 3D printing offers the capabilities and functions that provides a digital model with a physical one. This is especially useful for architectures in creating real life models with their own interests or designs in mind. Additionally, 3D printing could be used to create artwork in general that can be seen in things such as jewelry (ex. lasercut earrings) and fashion (ex. the soles of platform sneakers). 

In Rhizome Anthology, one artwork that could qualify for *Gesamtkunstwerk* is the "My Boyfriend Came Back From The War" (1996) by Olia Lialina. This artwork infuses both cinema and web to narrate and illustrate the story between two lovers. The black and white photos are displayed like a storyboard in a movie or film. In the digital aspect, one could click on the hyperlinked phrases and images to be taken into other windows. Although not all types of arts are present in this piece, it explores a new way to create art through film and the digital web.
